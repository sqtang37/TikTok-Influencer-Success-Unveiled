# TikTok-Influencer-Success-Unveiled

## Project Overview

This project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to gain insights into the trends and patterns of successful TikTok influencers. The data for this analysis is obtained through TikTok metadata scraping. The analysis focuses on the top 20 influencers, examining their video information through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and influencer segmentation. Additionally, a predictive model is trained using this data, and its accuracy is tested on another set of 20 outstanding influencers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main sections within the Jupyter notebook:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, the dataset is explored and visualized to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights related to the top 20 TikTok influencers. Various statistical and visual techniques are employed to understand the characteristics of the data.

### 2. Influencer Segmentation

The influencers are segmented, using K-Mean Clustering algorithm, based on a few factors to identify common traits or characteristics among them. This segmentation analysis provides a deeper understanding of the diverse influencer landscape on TikTok.

### 3. Predictive Modeling

This section involves the training of a predictive model using Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on the data from the top 20 influencers and is designed to predict the number of 'Likes'. The accuracy of the model is then evaluated using data from another set of 20 outstanding influencers.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to unveil the success factors of TikTok influencers. By combining exploratory data analysis, influencer segmentation, and predictive modeling, the project aims to provide valuable insights to aspiring influencers. The findings can serve as a guide, helping individuals increase their chances of going viral on TikTok and ultimately achieving success on the platform.

## How to Use the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Navigate to the EDA section to explore visualizations and insights related to the top 20 influencers' data.

2. **Influencer Segmentation:** Move on to the segmentation section to understand the different influencer segments identified in the analysis.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Explore the predictive modeling section to delve into the details of the trained model and its accuracy on the test set of 20 outstanding influencers.

This project aims to contribute to the understanding of TikTok influencer success and provide actionable insights for individuals aspiring to achieve similar success on the platform. Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook and discover the key factors that can help you increase your chances of going viral on TikTok.
